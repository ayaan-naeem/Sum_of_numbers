## Simple Console Calculator in C#

Welcome to my first little C# console project! 🎉

This is a basic console application where you can enter two numbers, and it will calculate and display their sum. It's a simple program, but it marks the beginning of my journey into mastering C# and building more advanced programs in the future.

## Features

Takes user input for two numbers.

Calculates the sum of the numbers.

Uses Console.Write and Console.WriteLine for input/output formatting.

Demonstrates basic variable usage, parsing input, and string interpolation in C#.

## How to Use

Clone this repository.

Open the project in Visual Studio (or your preferred C# IDE).

Run the program.

Follow the prompts to enter two numbers.

See the calculated sum printed on the console.

## Example:

Enter the first number: 5
Enter the second number: 7
The sum will be: 12

## Notes

This is just the beginning! 🚀

The project is intended for learning the basics of C# console programming, including:

Console.Write vs Console.WriteLine

int.Parse for converting user input

String interpolation $""

Future updates will include more operations, error handling, and better input validation.

## Contributing

Feel free to fork this repository and experiment!
I’m just starting out, so expect small steps first. 🐣
